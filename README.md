# Machine Vision : Image-Processing-Project
My latest project on Machine Vision! 🚀 This project focuses on exploring the fundamentals of Digital Image Processing and builds a complete pipeline for object detection and enhancement.

🔍 What’s Inside?
 1️⃣ Preprocessing: Noise removal and binarization for cleaner data.
 2️⃣ Edge Detection: Techniques like Sobel, Prewitt, and Canny to identify boundaries.
 3️⃣ Morphological Operations: Refining objects using erosion, dilation, opening, and closing.
 4️⃣ Object Detection: Contour detection and bounding boxes to highlight key regions.
 5️⃣ Visualization: A clear, step-by-step visual representation of the pipeline.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
1. Python
2. OpenCV for image processing
3. Matplotlib for visualization
4. NumPy for efficient computations

📌 Note:
 This output is part of my exploration, and while it showcases the pipeline's functionality, it's not perfect. Some regions are misclassified, highlighting areas for further refinement and learning.

 💡 Takeaways:
1. The project demonstrates how preprocessing and advanced techniques like morphological operations can refine object detection.
2. It’s a testament to the learning process and the iterative nature of working in Machine Vision.
